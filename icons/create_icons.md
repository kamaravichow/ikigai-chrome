# Icon Creation Instructions

You need to create the following icon files for your Chrome extension:

1. `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
2. `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
3. `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva.

For a simple placeholder, you can use a solid color square with your initial or a simple symbol.

Once created, place these PNG files in this directory to replace this placeholder file.
